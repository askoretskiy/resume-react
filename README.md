# Lean React

This project is a lean boilerplate for using React in your project.

You could use React, React-DOM and JSX here.

Your code would run as-is (besides JSX transformation), so ES support depends on your browser.

As of February 2018 (e.g. Chrome 64+ / Firefox 58+), you could use all decent ECMAScript features, even spread operator for objects.

# Build
